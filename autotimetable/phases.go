/*
	Main processing phase(s), accumulating constraints.

In this phase instances are run which try to add the (as yet not included)
constraints of a single type, with a given timeout. A certain number of
these can be run in parallel. If one completes successfully, it is removed
from the constraint list. All the other instances are stopped and the
successful instance is used as the base for a new cycle. Depending on the
time this instance took to complete, the timeout may be increased.

There is some flexibility around the timeouts. If an instance seems to be
progressing too slowly, it can be halted immediately. On the other hand,
if the instance looks like it might complete if given a little more time,
the timeout is delayed.

When an instance times out, it is removed from the constraint list. It is
split into two, each with half of the constraints, the new instances being
added to the constraint list and to the end of the run-queue. If the
instance has only one constraint to add, no new instance is started â€“ until
the next cycle.

When the constraint list is empty, the cycle ends. For the next cycle, the
as yet unincluded constraints are collected again and the timeout is
increased somewhat.

Should it come to pass that all the constraints have been added successfully
(unlikely, because the overall timeout will have been reached or the
hard-only or full instance will have completed already), phase 3 is entered,
indicating that there are no more constraints to add.
