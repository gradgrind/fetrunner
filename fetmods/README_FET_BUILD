To build the `fetrunner` GUI along with `FET`:

Copy the `fetrunner` base directory to the `FET` base directory.

Replace the `fet.pro` in the `FET` base directory by the one in this directory.

Add  `src-clw.pro` from this directory to the `FET` `src` directory.

Compile `libfetrunner` to a static library, as described in `fetrunner/libfetrunner/README`.

Compile `FET` as usual.
