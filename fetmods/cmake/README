Linux
=====

In FET root folder:

Copy in the folders/files from src and src-cl in this directory.

Copy in the fetrunner folder (precompile libfetrunner).

mkdir build
cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/Qt/6.10.1/gcc_64 .. --install-prefix $PWD/usr

cmake --build . --target install -j 4

Copy the result (usr/ from build/) into the fet binary tree. It should enable native file dialogs and Wayland support. But overwrites (incl. usr/bin/qt.conf) should probably be skipped.
