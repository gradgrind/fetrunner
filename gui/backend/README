Linux:

To build a static library:

go build -buildmode=c-archive -o libfetrunner.a fetrunner.go

To build a shared library:

go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libfetrunner.so fetrunner.go


What about other platforms?!

On Windows, at least gcc/g++ may be OK with .a archives. For shared
libraries, I guess it would have to be .dll.
