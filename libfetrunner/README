To build a static library:

CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -buildmode=c-archive libfetrunner.go

(Although CGO_ENABLED=1 is, normally, the default for native builds, I needed it on Windows.)

To build a shared library on Linux:

go build -buildmode=c-shared -o libfetrunner.so libfetrunner.go

On Windows and Darwin the output file will presumably need adapting.

Cross-compile Linux to Windows:

GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1 CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc go build -buildmode=c-archive libfetrunner/libfetrunner.go
